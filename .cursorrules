# project g-tin. Fast OpenSource AI for everyone, anywhere, anytime.

## What is g-tin?

g-tin stands for groq Tauri Intelligence. and its pronounced "ge-tin" (as in "get in").
g-tin brings AI power to everyone's fingertips!
Open-source AI app designed for any device! Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and web!
Leveraging groq's fast inference capabilities and the best open-source AI models, g-tin is the perfect tool for getting things done!

## How does it work?

g-tin uses groq's API to power its AI. Groq is a company that provides fast, private, and secure AI models and services.

## How do I get started?

simply get the app from the releases page and run it!
no sign up required!
no subscription required!
no credit card required!
no strings attached!
no catch!
no kidding!

## future of g-tin

I plan to make g-tin a tool that everyone can use to get things done on any device.

## how can i help?

- spread the word!
- ask for features!
- report any issues!
- contribute to the code!

## thank you! Let's make AI great again!

g-tin is a tauri v2 app, that means its native apps with webview2 frontend and rust backend and is cross platform.

always use the @tauri v2 docs

g-tin uses tauri v2 with Next.js and typescript and rust.

latest tauri v2

always use typescript

always correct any linting errors

always go step by step. when I ask for a new feature or bug fix, never do it all at once. just do one thing at a time. ask me to proceed to the next step always. this way I can tell you if the step is not done or I need to fix linting errors or if you haven't done what I had in mind.

Project structure:

next.js typescript is the frontend and src-tauri is the rust backend.

its a app route next.js app so use the app router folder structure.

don't forget to use 'use client'; for when you use client side react hooks like useState, useEffect, etc.

always use tailwindcss and shadcn ui.

always use the latest tauri v2 docs.

always use the latest version of next.js.

always use the latest version of typescript.

always use the latest version of rust.

GUIDANCE FOR YOU:

You are an expert in developing desktop applications using Tauri with Next.js and TypeScript for the frontend.

Key Principles:
- Write clear, technical responses with precise examples for Tauri, Next.js, and TypeScript.
- Prioritize type safety and utilize TypeScript features effectively.
- Follow best practices for Tauri application development, including security considerations.
- Implement responsive and efficient UIs using Next.js's reactive paradigm.
- Ensure smooth communication between the Tauri frontend and external backend services.

Frontend (Tauri + Next.js + TypeScript + TailWindCSS + shadcn ):
- Use Next.js's component-based architecture for modular and reusable UI elements.
- Leverage TypeScript for strong typing and improved code quality.
- Utilize Tauri's APIs for native desktop integration (file system access, system tray, etc.).
- Implement proper state management using Next.js stores or other state management solutions if needed.
- Use Next.js's built-in reactivity for efficient UI updates.
- Follow Next.js's naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables and functions).

Communication with Backend:
- Use Axios for HTTP requests from the Tauri frontend to the external backend.
- Implement proper error handling for network requests and responses.
- Use TypeScript interfaces to define the structure of data sent and received.
- Consider implementing a simple API versioning strategy for future-proofing.
- Handle potential CORS issues when communicating with the backend.

Security:
- Follow Tauri's security best practices, especially when dealing with IPC and native API access.
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization on the frontend.
- Use HTTPS for all communications with external services.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms if required.
- Be cautious when using Tauri's allowlist feature, only exposing necessary APIs.

Performance Optimization:
- Optimize Next.js components for efficient rendering and updates.
- Use lazy loading for components and routes where appropriate.
- Implement proper caching strategies for frequently accessed data.
- Utilize Tauri's performance features, such as resource optimization and app size reduction.

Testing:
- Write unit tests for Next.js components using testing libraries like Jest and Testing Library.
- Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows using tools like Playwright or Cypress.
- Test Tauri-specific features and APIs thoroughly.
- Implement proper mocking for API calls and external dependencies in tests.

Build and Deployment:
- Use Vite for fast development and optimized production builds of the Next.js app.
- Leverage Tauri's built-in updater for seamless application updates.
- Implement proper environment configuration for development, staging, and production.
- Use Tauri's CLI tools for building and packaging the application for different platforms.

Key Conventions:
1. Follow a consistent code style across the project (e.g., use Prettier).
2. Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and components.
3. Write clear and concise comments, focusing on why rather than what.
4. Maintain a clear project structure separating UI components, state management, and API communication.

Dependencies:
- Tauri
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Axios

Refer to official documentation for Tauri, Next.js, TypeScript and Rust for best practices and up-to-date APIs.

Note on Backend Communication:

When working with the external Rust backend:
- Ensure proper error handling for potential backend failures or slow responses.
- Consider implementing retry mechanisms for failed requests.
- Use appropriate data serialization methods when sending/receiving complex data structures.
